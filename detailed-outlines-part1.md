POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: Timber Ridge town, closed mill site, county morgue
Time: Afternoon, same day

* **Purpose:** Establish economic devastation context, introduce community hostility, provide forensic details establishing serial pattern.

* **Beats:** Claire gives Marcus town tour—shuttered Olympic Timber Mill, empty company store, laid-off workers drinking midday at Timber Ridge Tavern. Population 800 declining, unemployment above 20 percent, families leaving. Canvas interviews: motel clerk, diner owner, gas station attendant—all defensive, hostile to federal badge, blame "outsiders and environmentalists" for industry death. Marcus struggles with community resistance; Claire understands timber loyalty but must push through. Visit second crime scene at closed mill site—similar staging, isolation, photography evidence. Meet Dr. Ellen Price at makeshift county morgue in Port Angeles—cramped facilities, limited equipment. Autopsy findings: three victims total, all strangulation, sexual assault, photographed post-mortem, similar methodology. Period forensics constraints: waiting days-to-weeks for state lab results in Olympia. Marcus begins profile framework; Claire warns timber families won't cooperate.

## Chapter 3: Family Complications

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Alternating—Claire, then Marcus
Setting: Jack Novak's house, Timber Trail Motor Court
Time: Evening

* **Purpose:** Establish Claire's family rift and personal cost, contrast Marcus's isolated theoretical approach.

* **Beats:** Claire visits father Jack Novak's house outside Timber Ridge—third-generation logger's home filled with timber work memories. Tense dinner with father and two brothers (all loggers, all unemployed). Jack refuses to discuss unemployed mill workers or logging road access—"You chose that badge over family." Brothers silent, hostile to her investigator role. Claire argues lives at stake; Jack counters timber community already destroyed by federal government. No cooperation, only judgment. Claire's conflict: badge versus blood, justice versus loyalty. Meanwhile Marcus at Timber Trail Motor Court reviewing case files alone—wood-paneled room, rotary phone, spreading papers across bed. Calls FBI Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, discusses victim selection (transient hitchhikers), disposal methodology (territorial marking), photography obsession (documentation). His theoretical framework developing. Cross-cut structure shows both investigators isolated: Claire rejected by family, Marcus alone with theories.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jack Novak's bitterness about industry collapse and daughter's betrayal. Brothers' silent judgment. Claire defending investigation necessity. Marcus's Quantico consultation about behavioral patterns and victim vulnerabilities. His discussion of emerging profiling methodology.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire hurt by family rejection but resolute about duty—badge cost clear. Marcus intellectually engaged but emotionally disconnected—theories comfortable, human context difficult. Both alone in hostile territory for different reasons.

* **Key Details:** Jack's chainsaw collection and logging photographs. Dinner with Olympia beer and pot roast. Brothers' calloused hands and flannel shirts. Marcus's motel room with cinder-block walls. Rotary phone long-distance call. FBI case files in manila folders. Spring rain on window.

## Chapter 4: Victim Profile

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Peninsula Junction truck stop, Highway 101
Time: Morning, next day

* **Purpose:** Establish victim pattern and vulnerabilities, introduce witness Betty Carson, refine predator targeting methodology.

* **Beats:** Marcus and Claire interview Betty Carson, night shift clerk at Peninsula Junction truck stop—major crossroads where Highway 101 meets logging road access. Betty remembers hitchhikers passing through: young women, early twenties, California or Oregon, heading to Seattle or Portland. "I warn them about rides but they're trusting, think locals are safe." Witnessed several victims: Sarah Kern (22, Sacramento), Jennifer Hale (19, San Francisco), Lisa Drummond (24, San Diego)—all accepting rides from "nice guys in clean trucks." Descriptions frustratingly vague—everyone drives trucks in timber country. Victims' identifications reviewed: all hitchhiking north spring 1978, all disappeared March-April, all found in clear-cuts days-to-weeks later. Marcus develops profile: predator targeting transient population whose disappearance won't trigger immediate investigation. Families delayed reporting—daughters traveling, communication uncertain. Claire notes Highway 101 funnels hitchhikers through timber territory creating opportunity structure. Recognition: vulnerable travelers exploited by someone appearing helpful.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Betty describing hitchhikers and her warnings. Details about victims accepting rides—friendly drivers, clean trucks, heading "toward Seattle." Discussion of delayed missing persons reports due to travel uncertainty and slow 1970s communication. Marcus explaining predator target selection. Claire providing context about timber country courtesy culture.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus intellectually engaged by victim vulnerability pattern—sees behavioral equation solving. Claire sympathetic to victims and Betty's guilt about not preventing disappearances. Both frustrated by vague witness descriptions.

* **Key Details:** Truck stop diner with Formica counters and coffee pots. Betty's Marlboro cigarettes and waitress uniform. Highway 101 traffic—logging trucks and hitchhikers. Gas pumps showing 65 cents per gallon. Payphone outside. Victims' photographs from families. Period detail: no instant communication, travel uncertainty normal.

## Chapter 5: The Charm Approach

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: Various witness locations, third crime scene clear-cut
Time: Afternoon

* **Purpose:** Identify Bundy-style charm methodology, establish killer's local integration and timber knowledge requirement.

* **Beats:** Witness canvas continues—truck stop waitress remembers victim getting coffee with "friendly local guy, clean truck, helpful demeanor, offered ride toward Seattle." Gas station attendant recalls similar encounter. Marcus identifies behavioral pattern: Bundy-style charm approach—predator presents as trustworthy, uses local knowledge to gain confidence quickly. Claire explains timber culture context: offering rides is common courtesy, locals help travelers, community trust assumed. Killer exploits these values. Discussion of victim selection: confident enough to hitchhike, trusting of friendly locals, vulnerable in isolated territory. Visit third crime scene—different clear-cut, same staging pattern, same photography evidence. Claire observes: "He knows which clear-cuts are abandoned, which logging roads see regular traffic, which vantage points timber cruisers use." Territory-specific knowledge required. Marcus refines profile: organized offender, comfortable with social interaction, uses charm not force initially, requires intimate timber country knowledge. Conclusion: killer lives or works in logging community.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Witnesses describing friendly helpful driver—"seemed safe, local guy, knew the area." Marcus explaining Bundy methodology and organized offender characteristics. Claire discussing timber courtesy culture and how it creates victim vulnerability. Both recognizing killer's community integration.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire conflicted—someone from her community exploiting timber values to murder. Marcus professionally focused but beginning to understand cultural context matters. Both frustrated by killer's social camouflage.

* **Key Details:** Third clear-cut crime scene with slash piles and stumps. Spring mud and boot prints. Film residue evidence markers. Claire's territorial reading—abandoned versus active logging areas. Timber cruiser orange flagging tape. Photography evidence bags. Period forensics: sending samples to state lab, waiting days for results.

## Chapter 6: Logging Road Networks

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Defunct timber company headquarters, Dale Morton's security office
Time: Morning, next day

* **Purpose:** Establish vast logging road network enabling crimes, introduce access control complications, expand suspect pool.

* **Beats:** Meet Dale Morton, logging company security supervisor at Olympic Timber Corporation headquarters—now skeleton crew managing private lands. Office in abandoned administrative building with maps covering walls. Dale territorial, defensive about private road access—"Company property, we control gates and keys." Reluctantly provides road map showing hundreds of miles of logging roads spanning Olympic Peninsula company land. Access supposedly limited to employees and contractors but Dale admits enforcement minimal: "Half the unemployed loggers still have keys, gates get bypassed, we're skeleton crew." Marcus comprehends scope—vast network enabling mobility and isolation across private land. Claire knows reality—logging families share access, codes circulate, territorial boundaries fluid. Sheriff Halstead pressures Dale about cooperation and obstruction. Dale provides contractor lists—salvage companies, maintenance workers, timber cruisers maintaining access despite mill closures. Paper records, manual cross-referencing needed. Suspect pool: potentially hundreds of unemployed timber workers with road access and territorial knowledge.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Dale defending company access control while admitting enforcement failures. Marcus asking about who maintains keys and gate codes. Sheriff pressuring cooperation. Claire questioning which contractors work current routes. Discussion of paper records and manual investigation requirements.

Dale's ex-logger build and territorial attitude. Coffee from percolator. Period detail: paper records, no digital databases, manual cross-referencing required. Radio communication equipment for security patrols.

## Chapter 7: Timber Ridge Tavern

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: Timber Ridge Tavern
Time: Late afternoon

* **Purpose:** Demonstrate community code of silence, show investigator hostility, establish timber worker defensive psychology.

* **Beats:** Marcus and Claire enter hostile territory—Timber Ridge Tavern where laid-off mill workers drink afternoons. Walt Drummond owns bar, protective of regulars—barrel-chested, graying beard, ex-logger turned owner after injury. Investigator badges create immediate silence—conversations stop, patrons stare. Walt defensive: "Everyone here is hurting, nobody's killing hitchhikers." Marcus attempts professional interview approach; patrons hostile to federal profiler—"FBI killed our jobs." Claire tries timber family connection but her badge marks her traitor—"Jack Novak's daughter chose the wrong side." Canvas questions about trucks, logging road access, anyone acting strange receive vague or hostile responses. One regular mutters about "California girls bringing trouble to timber country." Marcus observes: unemployed men, bitter about industry death, protective loyalty, code of silence impenetrable. Walt eventually admits: "Lots of guys still drive logging roads—salvage work, equipment recovery, checking trap lines, looking for scrap." Period atmosphere: jukebox country music, Rainier beer neon, cigarette smoke, wood-paneled walls, pool table. Community won't cooperate unless forced.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Walt's protective deflections. Patrons' hostile responses to investigation questions. Marcus asking about truck access and regular customers. Claire attempting timber family appeals. Discussion of salvage work and continued logging road use. Bitter comments about industry death and outsider blame.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire feels community rejection viscerally—these are her people turning against her. Marcus professionally frustrated but beginning to understand cultural loyalty depth. Both recognize investigation will require breaking code of silence forcibly.

Walt's defensive posture behind bar. Marcus's outsider status visible. Claire's family connection worthless with badge visible.

## Chapter 8: Photography Evidence

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Sheriff's office evidence room, various interviews
Time: Morning

* **Purpose:** Establish photography obsession as key profile element, identify documentation pattern, narrow killer psychology.

* **Beats:** Evidence review session at sheriff's office. Dr. Price provides detailed forensics report: film chemical residue on all three victims, specific positioning marks indicating post-mortem photography, consistent staging methodology. Killer documented victims after death. Marcus examines crime scene photographs—artistic staging, deliberate composition, bodies positioned as subjects not discarded. Photography obsession discussion: predator creating narrative, documenting work, possibly keeping photos as trophies. Claire asks around timber community about camera hobbyists—common in 1970s but serious photographers with darkroom equipment more limited. Photography requires planning, chemical knowledge, development capability. Marcus refines behavioral profile: organized killer with photography interest, creating journey documentation—victims traveling through territory he controls, their interrupted passages documented. Staging in clear-cuts serves as display—theatrical but purposeful. Period photography context: film requires development, darkroom equipment, chemical processing, privacy for documentation. Sheriff begins inquiries about residents with photography hobbies. Photography obsession becomes central profile element—killer creating visual record of interrupted journeys.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Dr. Price explaining film residue and positioning evidence. Marcus discussing organized offender characteristics and trophy keeping. Claire asking about local photography hobbyists. Sheriff coordinating inquiries about darkroom equipment purchases. Discussion of 1970s photography technology and privacy requirements.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus intellectually engaged by documentation pattern—sees psychological framework clarifying. Claire disturbed by theatrical staging—killer treating victims as art subjects. Both recognizing photography provides investigative angle.

POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: Jack Novak's workshop, various timber family interviews
Time: Afternoon

* **Purpose:** Show Claire's personal sacrifice, break community silence partially, advance investigation through family connection cost.

* **Beats:** Claire confronts father directly at his workshop—surrounded by chainsaw equipment, timber memories, logging photographs. Heated confrontation: Claire demands help identifying unemployed loggers with continued road access, anyone acting strange, anyone with photography hobby. Jack refuses—"I won't help you hunt desperate men protecting their dignity in dying industry." Claire argues lives at stake; Jack counters timber families already destroyed by federal government and environmental regulations. Emotional confrontation about career choice: badge loyalty versus family loyalty. Jack: "Your badge cost you your place here—brothers won't talk to you, cousins avoid you, town sees you as betrayer." Claire holds ground but relationship fractures permanently. Meanwhile Marcus interviews other timber families—similar resistance, code of silence protecting community. Claire's cousin eventually provides limited information: salvage companies still employ handful of drivers for equipment recovery from closed mill sites. Claire returns from father visit visibly shaken. Marcus respects her sacrifice. Community barrier slightly cracked but personal cost significant—family rift likely permanent.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Claire pleading for information to save lives. Jack defending timber community loyalty and refusing cooperation. Emotional argument about badge versus family. Jack's accusations about betrayal. Claire's defense of investigation necessity. Cousin's reluctant information about salvage employment. Marcus acknowledging Claire's sacrifice.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire devastated by father's final rejection but resolute about duty—understands family relationship broken permanently. Jack torn between loyalty and conscience but chooses code. Marcus witnessing Claire's sacrifice deepens his respect for her commitment.

## Chapter 10: Pattern Recognition

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Sheriff's office, Peninsula Junction truck stop
Time: Late afternoon into evening

* **Purpose:** Consolidate Act One discoveries, establish comprehensive profile, trigger Act Two with new victim disappearance.

* **Beats:** Marcus maps complete pattern at sheriff's office: victims disappeared along Highway 101 corridor, disposed in clear-cuts accessible from specific logging road spurs, found days-to-weeks later by timber workers, all spring 1978. Claire contributes territorial analysis: disposal sites chosen for visibility from vantage points known to timber cruisers and salvage drivers—killer marking territory like cruiser marks boundaries. Photography and staging indicate narrative creation: documenting interrupted journeys through his timber country. Profile consolidation: unemployed or under-employed timber worker, intimate logging road knowledge, photography obsession, seeking control through victim selection, targeting independent traveling women representing mobility he's lost. Industry collapse provides psychological stressor—emasculation, powerlessness, rage. While analyzing, urgent radio call—Sheriff Halstead reports another hitchhiker disappeared last night from Peninsula Junction. Witness saw young woman accept ride from "clean truck, friendly local heading to Seattle" around 10 PM. Same pattern, active threat. Pattern escalating. Victim: Amy Collins, 21, from Eugene, Oregon. Family contacted—unaware of hitchhiking route, expected Seattle arrival. Timeline: disappeared approximately 18 hours ago. Act One turning point: need to narrow suspect pool immediately.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Marcus explaining complete behavioral profile to Claire and Sheriff. Claire contributing territorial knowledge about disposal site selection. Discussion of psychological stressors and victim symbolism. Urgent radio communication about new disappearance. Witness interview at truck stop. Family contact coordination. Agreement about investigation urgency.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus satisfied with profile coherence—pattern clear, methodology understood. Then urgency hits with new disappearance—intellectual puzzle becomes immediate rescue operation. Claire feels investigation pressure—victim possibly still alive, time critical.

* **Key Details:** Office wall map with pins marking crime scenes and victim disappearances. Marcus's behavioral profile typed on carbon-copy paper. Claire's territorial annotations on logging road maps. Radio call interrupting analysis. Night drive to Peninsula Junction. Betty Carson describing latest victim. Payphone calls to victim's family. Spring night rain. Urgency replacing methodical investigation pace.

## Chapter 11: Emasculation Theory

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Sheriff's office conference
Time: Morning, next day

* **Purpose:** Refine behavioral profile with emasculation theory, connect psychological framework to economic devastation, narrow suspect parameters.

* **Beats:** Marcus presents refined behavioral profile to Claire and Sheriff Halstead. Killer likely emasculated by timber industry collapse—lost identity as provider, worker, skilled tradesman. Traditional masculine role destroyed: job gone, possibly wife supporting family, status diminished. Targeting independent traveling women compensates for powerlessness—exerts control over mobile autonomous victims representing everything he's lost. Photography creates control narrative—documenting their stopped journeys matches his interrupted life. Industry death provides psychological trigger—thousands of unemployed loggers watching economic collapse, families struggling, traditional roles reversed, rage at forces beyond control. Claire understands context viscerally: unemployment above 20 percent, wives taking service jobs, men's provider identity destroyed. Marcus explains predatory psychology: hitchhikers represent freedom and mobility—everything killer lost. Sheriff skeptical of "psychology talk" but recognizes profile narrows pool: unemployed timber workers with ongoing road access AND photography interest. Discussion of emasculation markers: wife as primary earner, resentment of independent women, need for dominance. Profile framework established—now systematic elimination process begins.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Marcus explaining emasculation psychology and trigger stressors. Claire providing timber industry context and traditional role expectations. Sheriff questioning profile usefulness versus concrete evidence. Discussion of how to identify suspects fitting parameters: unemployment records, salvage employment, photography hobbies, wife employment, behavioral complaints.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus confident in behavioral framework—pattern psychologically coherent. Claire connecting profile to real timber families she knows—theory becoming uncomfortable reality. Sheriff pragmatic—needs actionable suspect list not psychology lecture.

* **Key Details:** Sheriff's conference room with coffee percolator. Marcus's typed profile report distributed. Wall map showing economic devastation—closed mills marked. Discussion of 1970s male provider role expectations. Unemployment statistics. Claire's annotations about specific timber families fitting parameters. FBI Behavioral Science Unit references—emerging profiling methodology.

## Chapter 12: Salvage Company Records

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: County courthouse basement records room
Time: Afternoon

* **Purpose:** Narrow suspect pool through systematic records research, identify salvage workers with ongoing road access.

* **Beats:** Claire and Marcus work courthouse basement with county clerk Helen Moffett. Initial resistance—privacy concerns about employment records—until Sheriff Halstead pressures cooperation about obstruction. Dig through salvage company, maintenance contractor, and timber cruising employment records 1976-1978. Paper files, carbon copies, handwritten employment cards require manual cross-referencing. Searching for workers maintaining logging road access despite mill closures. Tedious systematic work: Claire creates lists, Marcus looks for behavioral patterns. Hours of dusty files and fluorescent lights. Compile 23 men who worked salvage or contract positions allowing continued road access. Cross-reference against witness descriptions (truck drivers, friendly demeanor, local knowledge). Narrow to 11 possibles who fit profile parameters. Discussion of investigation approach: background checks, discreet inquiries, building case methodically. Period detail: payphone coordination waiting for callbacks, hand-sorted records, typewritten notes. Marcus's methodical patience versus Claire's urgency creates productive tension. Manageable suspect pool identified—systematic elimination phase beginning.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Helen Moffett's privacy objections and eventual cooperation. Marcus and Claire discussing search methodology and cross-referencing. Names emerging from records—discussing whether each fits profile. Planning next steps: background checks and witness cross-references. Coordination about dividing suspect list for investigation.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire focused on systematic progress—feels investigation advancing through solid police work. Marcus satisfied with methodical approach—this is familiar investigative territory. Both tired from record-searching but encouraged by narrowing pool.

* **Key Details:** Courthouse basement with file boxes floor-to-ceiling. Dust motes in fluorescent light. Helen Moffett's defensive bureaucrat attitude. Carbon-copy employment cards. Handwritten records requiring interpretation. Coffee from thermoses. Typewriter for creating suspect lists. Manual cross-referencing with witness statements. Period detail: no computers, all paper research.

## Chapter 13: Background Checks

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Sheriff's office, various phone coordination
Time: Next day

* **Purpose:** Systematically eliminate suspects, identify two primary suspects including Ray Talbot, advance investigation focus.

* **Beats:** Systematic background investigation begins. Marcus and Claire divide 11-person suspect list, run checks through state police, FBI records, sheriff's department. Period investigation: calling agencies, waiting for callbacks, tracking paper trails, days-long process. Most suspects have clean criminal records—unemployed loggers, salvage workers, no history. Three show complications: domestic disturbance calls dismissed, bar fights with charges dropped, complaints of "odd behavior" with no follow-up. Marcus focuses on psychological markers: emasculation indicators, family structure where wife earns primary income, employment instability. Claire focuses on practical verification: which suspects genuinely have ongoing logging road access, truck types matching witness descriptions, photography interests. Cross-reference witness descriptions—"friendly, clean truck, helpful demeanor." Narrow list to five strong possibles, then focus intensifies on two names appearing repeatedly: Leonard Watts (maintenance supervisor) and Ray Talbot (salvage driver). Both fit multiple profile parameters. Discussion of prioritization and investigation approach. Period detail: rotary phone coordination, carbon-copy reports, waiting days for information from multiple agencies. Ray Talbot emerges as strongest suspect based on emasculation markers and access patterns.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Coordinating background check requests with various agencies. Discussing suspects as information returns—eliminating or elevating based on profile fit. Marcus explaining behavioral markers in records. Claire identifying access verification and witness description matches. Decision to focus on Talbot and Watts as primary suspects. Planning deeper investigation approach.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus satisfied with systematic elimination—methodology working. Claire increasingly focused as suspects narrow—feeling closer to killer. Both experiencing investigation momentum building toward identification.

* **Key Details:** Sheriff's office phones ringing with callbacks. Carbon-copy reports piling up. Suspect list being annotated and narrowed. Coffee consumption increasing. Marcus's detailed notes on psychological markers. Claire's access verification charts. Period coordination: multiple agencies, slow information flow, days-long waits. FBI records access. State police cooperation.

## Chapter 14: Ray Talbot Emerges

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Claire Novak, third-person limited
Setting: Various investigation locations, records review
Time: Afternoon

* **Purpose:** Identify Ray Talbot as primary suspect, establish profile alignment, build circumstantial case foundation.

* **Beats:** Deep investigation into Ray Talbot begins. Background compilation: age 34, worked Olympic Peninsula mills since 18—green chain puller, mill floor, eventually fork operator. Laid off when mill closed 1977, joined thousands unemployed. Wife Lynn Talbot works receptionist at insurance office—primary family income. Clean criminal record but two complaints: "odd behavior" toward women at Peninsula Junction truck stop, dismissed as misunderstandings. Lives trailer park outside Timber Ridge. Drives pickup for Olympic Salvage Company recovering equipment from closed mill sites—legitimate logging road access across company property. Marcus identifies emasculation markers: wife as breadwinner, industry collapse destroyed provider role, loss of masculine identity. Claire identifies territorial access: Talbot's salvage routes coincide geographically with disposal site areas. Betty Carson at truck stop recognizes name: "Ray Talbot, regular customer, always polite, saw him offer rides to hitchhikers couple times." Additional background: photography hobby, built darkroom in trailer. Sheriff Halstead knows him: "Quiet guy, kept to himself, seemed normal—like everyone else hurting." Profile alignment: unemployed timber worker, photography interest, road access, wife supporting family, witness placement. Talbot becomes primary suspect—investigation focuses.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Compiling Talbot's employment history and family situation. Betty Carson confirming his truck stop presence and hitchhiker interactions. Sheriff discussing Talbot's community reputation. Marcus explaining profile alignment—all parameters matching. Claire identifying salvage route and disposal site geographic overlap. Planning investigation approach: surveillance, evidence gathering, building prosecutable case.

* **Emotional Arc:** Claire feels investigation converging—Talbot fits perfectly, too many coincidences. Marcus professionally confident profile accuracy but cautious about confirmation bias. Both alert to finally having primary suspect after systematic elimination.

* **Key Details:** Talbot's employment records showing mill closure and salvage work. Wife's employment providing family income. Trailer park address. Salvage company work records. Betty's positive identification from truck stop. Photography hobby details—darkroom in trailer bathroom. Sheriff's community knowledge. Geographic overlay of Talbot's routes and crime scenes. Period detail: paper trail research, multiple source confirmation.

## Chapter 15: Surveillance Complications

Target Word Count: 1,700 words
POV: Marcus Reid, third-person limited
Setting: Timber Ridge area, logging roads, Talbot's trailer park
Time: Morning, next day

* **Purpose:** Establish surveillance difficulty, show Talbot's territorial advantage, recognize need for different approach.

* **Beats:** Attempt surveillance on Ray Talbot begins. Locate trailer at modest park outside Timber Ridge—weathered Ford pickup parked outside. But surveillance immediately complicated: Talbot knows logging road networks better than any map, moves through territory with intimate knowledge gained from years of timber work. Marcus and Claire try discreet observation but timber country offers no anonymity—strangers noticed immediately, limited roads make tail obvious. Talbot's salvage work takes him across vast private road networks where following without revealing presence impossible. He spots tail vehicle easily on rural two-lane roads, alters behavior. Discussion of approach dilemma: direct interview risks spooking him if guilty, but surveillance impractical in territory he controls. Claire suggests checking salvage company records—which specific sites Talbot accesses, matching against disposal locations. Marcus frustrated by terrain limiting standard surveillance techniques. Period constraints: no GPS tracking, no cell phone monitoring, no technology shortcuts—old-fashioned surveillance exposed by geography. Talbot maintains advantage through territorial knowledge. Need alternative evidence-gathering approach before direct confrontation. Recognize systematic case-building requires access records and physical evidence, not surveillance.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Marcus and Claire discussing surveillance positioning and approach. Recognizing when Talbot spots tail. Frustration about rural road limitations—no traffic to blend into. Discussion of alternative approaches: salvage company cooperation, access records, physical evidence from sites. Sheriff's advice about timber country surveillance difficulty. Planning evidence gathering instead of observation.

* **Emotional Arc:** Marcus frustrated by surveillance failure—his FBI training inadequate for vast timber territory. Claire unsurprised—knows terrain advantages locals. Both recognizing need to adapt investigation methods to geography and suspect's territorial knowledge.

* **Key Details:** Talbot's trailer park—weathered single-wides, Ford pickup, quiet morning. Surveillance attempt from parked vehicle—immediately obvious. Logging roads with no traffic for concealment. Talbot's salvage truck driving confidently through territory. Marcus and Claire's coordination via radio. Discussion about GPS and tracking technology not existing in 1978. Period surveillance limitations: physical observation only, no electronic monitoring. Timber country vastness defeating standard techniques.
